We'll cover everything from project setup to advanced features and best practices.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>First, let's set up our development environment. We'll use Vite for a lightning-fast development experience:</p><pre><code>npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts</code></pre><h2>Project Structure</h2><p>A well-organized project structure is crucial for maintainability. Here's a recommended structure:</p><ul><li>src/<ul><li>components/</li><li>pages/</li><li>hooks/</li><li>utils/</li><li>types/</li></ul></li></ul><h2>TypeScript Best Practices</h2><p>TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making our code more reliable and maintainable. Here are some best practices:</p><ul><li>Use interfaces for object shapes</li><li>Leverage type inference</li><li>Create custom type guards</li></ul><h2>Performance Optimization</h2><p>Performance is crucial for a great user experience. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use React.memo for expensive components</li><li>Implement code splitting</li><li>Optimize images and assets</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Building modern web applications with React and TypeScript is an exciting journey. With the right tools and practices, you can create amazing user experiences.</p>",
